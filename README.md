## 💡 Inspiration

The demand for hyper-personalization is growing rapidly as customers expect experiences tailored to their unique preferences. Leading companies like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify have set the benchmark by leveraging AI to offer personalized recommendations that drive engagement and customer satisfaction.

However, many businesses struggle to implement such sophisticated AI-driven personalization due to challenges like data silos, lack of real-time insights, and limited AI adoption.

RecomAI was inspired by the need to bridge this gap by creating a scalable, AI-powered recommendation system that not only personalizes customer experiences but also provides businesses with valuable insights to enhance customer engagement and retention.

By combining Generative AI, deep learning, and sentiment analysis, our solution aims to redefine hyper-personalization, ensuring businesses can deliver the right content, product, or service to the right customer at the right time.

## ⚙️ What It Does

RecomAI is an AI-powered hyper-personalization engine that analyzes customer data to deliver real-time, personalized recommendations for products, services, or content. It helps businesses enhance customer engagement by leveraging Generative AI, sentiment analysis, and behavioral insights to understand and predict user preferences.

Key Features:

✅ Customer Profiling – Aggregates and analyzes customer data from multiple sources (purchase history, demographics, social media, etc.).

✅ AI-Driven Recommendations – Uses Generative AI to deliver personalized product, service, or content suggestions.

✅ Sentiment Analysis – Understands customer emotions through social media activity, reviews, and feedback.

✅ Behavior Prediction – Predicts future customer interactions and preferences based on historical data.

✅ Business Insights – Provides actionable reports to help businesses optimize engagement and marketing strategies.

✅ Real-Time Adaptation – Continuously refines recommendations based on new data and user behavior.

With Echo Mind- Smart Recommendation System, businesses can go beyond generic recommendations and offer hyper-personalized experiences, driving customer satisfaction, loyalty, and increased revenue.

## 🛠️ How We Built It

The development of Echo Mind- Smart Recommendation System involved multiple stages, from data collection and preprocessing to model training and deployment. Our approach combined data-driven insights, AI-powered recommendations, and real-time user interaction to create a seamless hyper-personalization engine.

🏗 Development Process:

1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing

Collected structured and unstructured data from customer profiles, purchase history, and sentiment analysis sources.

Used Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.

2️⃣ AI Model Development

Integrated a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate personalized recommendations.

Implemented sentiment analysis to refine recommendations based on user emotions.

GenAI Financial Recommendation Engine

Project Methodology

This Project using the Open Source Data of Company Products information with their DEMOG and BUREAU data.
Using Python, that load data and then pre-processed and saved in CSV File.
Loading that same CSV file to insert into Vector DB using Embedding Model from Hugging Face.
Building RAG QA Chain using Langchain and building the RAG architecture using Zypher 7B LLM (Open Source).
Checking Recommended product response from LLM.

Due to CPU limitations for running a Large Language Model locally, we have leveraged Google Colab GPU for running our LLM Model. On providing customer information from the synthetic dataset we created earlier, the LLM will analyze and generate banking product recommendations.

Run each cell.

3️⃣ Building the Recommendation Engine

Applied collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques.

Fine-tuned the LLM using domain-specific customer behavior data.

4️⃣ User Interface & Deployment

Developed an interactive UI using Streamlit for businesses to explore recommendations and insights.

Designed a real-time dashboard for businesses to monitor engagement and optimize personalization strategies.

By integrating LLMs with powerful data processing tools and an intuitive interface, RecomAI provides a scalable, AI-driven recommendation system that enhances customer engagement and business insights.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced

During the development of RecomAI, we encountered several challenges that pushed us to optimize our approach and refine our solution.

🔹 Data Collection & Integration – Aggregating and processing customer data from multiple sources (social media, purchase history, sentiment analysis) while ensuring data consistency and accuracy was challenging.

🔹 Finding the Right LLM -

🔹 Selecting the right dataset was crucial for training RecomAI to generate accurate and meaningful hyper-personalized recommendations. We needed datasets that contained diverse customer interactions, purchase behavior, sentiment data, and demographic details to build a robust AI model.
